# Cloning
Open Block relys on a small project (1 class) which is not provided within Maven. You can find a link to it here ... Wait i dont have it XD

## Intelij

- First copy the cloning link provided by GitHub.  
- Open Intelij to the Projects page
- Select "Version Control"
- Select "Git"
- Paste the copied link 
- Change the save location so the end folder is "Blocks/Blocks"
- Download/clone and wait
- Once Intelij has setup the enviroment close the project
- do the same with the small project (make sure its location is "Blocks/ArrayUntils"
- Close that project
- Open your "Blocks" project
- Click File
- Click "Project Settings"
- Select Module tab
- Select the + 
- Import existing project
- Select ArrayUtils 
- Once imported, select Blocks module
- Select "Depends" tab
- Select +
- select "Module Dependant"
- select "ArrayUtils"

### Using Pull Requests

Pull requests are a good idea as it prevents newer code messing with your code, it also means we can review and make changes before your changes get put into the main build. Pull requests are a good thing

On Intelij you can make a pull request module by the following

- on "projects" pane select your project
- on the toolbar hit "VCP"
- Now select "Pull Request"
- fill in the rest
